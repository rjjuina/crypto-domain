      <td>Satoshi Nakamoto mined Block 0 on January 3, 2009, embedding the headline "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks." This marked the birth of Bitcoin and the beginning of decentralized digital currency. The embedded message signaled the motivation behind creating an alternative to the traditional banking system.</td>

The event is celebrated annually as "Bitcoin Pizza Day" and became a symbol of Bitcoin's early days when its value was negligible.</td>

This first boom-bust cycle attracted early media attention and established BTC as a tradable asset rather than just a curiosity.</td>

Silk Road had facilitated over $1 billion in illegal transactions using Bitcoin as its primary currency. The shutdown was a watershed moment that drew mainstream attention to Bitcoin and prompted early regulatory debates about cryptocurrency's role in illicit finance.</td>

Gox, once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange handling over 70% of global BTC trades, filed for bankruptcy in February 2014 after revealing that approximately 850,000 BTC (~$450M at the time) had been stolen over several years. The collapse shattered trust in centralized exchanges and became crypto's most infamous security failure. It prompted the industry to prioritize proof-of-reserves and cold-storage practices.</td>

The Ethereum community voted to hard-fork the chain to reverse the theft, splitting the network into Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The incident raised fundamental questions about blockchain immutability and decentralized governance.</td>

      <td>The initial coin offering (ICO) mania peaked in mid-2017, with projects raising billions of dollars by selling tokens directly to the public — often with little more than a whitepaper. While some legitimate projects launched during this period, a large portion turned out to be scams or failed ventures. The frenzy attracted global regulatory attention and led to outright ICO bans in several jurisdictions.</td>

Crypto exchanges operating in mainland China were subsequently shut down. The ban sent shockwaves through global markets and began a long period of tightening Chinese crypto regulation that would culminate in a full mining ban in 2021.</td>

      <td>Bitcoin reached nearly $20,000 in December 2017, capping a parabolic rally fueled by retail speculation and the ICO boom. The launch of Bitcoin futures on CME and CBOE added institutional visibility. This was Bitcoin's first mainstream price peak, drawing extensive global media coverage and introducing millions of new participants to cryptocurrency.</td>

      <td>Crypto Market Crash</td>
      <td>Starting in January 2018, the crypto market experienced a prolonged crash that wiped out over 80% of total market capitalization. Bitcoin fell from its ~$20K peak to below $6K by February, and most altcoins lost 90%+ of their value. The crash, often called "crypto winter," was triggered by regulatory crackdowns, the collapse of the ICO bubble, and profit-taking after the 2017 mania.</td>

The "hash war" between Bitcoin Cash ABC (backed by Roger Ver and Bitmain) and Bitcoin SV (backed by Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre) divided the chain, community, and hashrate. The conflict further fragmented the Bitcoin fork ecosystem and damaged confidence in governance-by-fork.</td>

Operators were arrested across multiple countries. The sell-off of seized assets was large enough to measurably impact BTC and ETH market prices throughout 2019.</td>

The project immediately faced fierce regulatory pushback from governments worldwide who feared it could undermine monetary sovereignty. After multiple redesigns and rebranding to "Diem," the project was ultimately abandoned in 2022 — but it accelerated central bank digital currency (CBDC) research globally.</td>

      <td>On March 12, 2020, Bitcoin plunged roughly 50% in a single day — from ~$8,000 to below $4,000 — as the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global flight to cash across all asset classes. The crash cascaded through DeFi protocols and centralized exchanges, causing mass liquidations.

China had been home to over 50% of global Bitcoin hashrate; the ban triggered the largest hashrate migration in Bitcoin's history as miners relocated to the US, Kazakhstan, and other countries. The network's hashrate recovered within months, demonstrating Bitcoin's resilience.</td>
